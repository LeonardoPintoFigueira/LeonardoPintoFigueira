# üí´ About Me:
Hello! Since I was sixteen years old, I have grown interested in "hacker" topics and have begun to educate myself on subjects like bug bounty and pen-testing, among other things. <br><br>My original goal was to attend high school, but that changed after I discovered Code For All, which enabled me to move closer to my actual goal of working in cyber security.<br><br>My journey's objective is to become a penetration tester, but first I have a few steps to take. I plan to go step by step, making mistakes, picking up lessons, and eventually passing on what I've learned to someone.<br><br>It was nice to meeting you!! :D
